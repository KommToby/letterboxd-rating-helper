# letterboxd-rating-helper
Window that guides you through the process of rating your movies on letterboxd.
This uses a simple web scraper to get the movies you have watched from your letterboxd profile, and then displays them in a window for you to compare. After a number of comparisons, the window will give you a suggested rating.

# Usage
1. Fill in your letterboxd username into config.json so the script knows which user to check
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script (main.py)
